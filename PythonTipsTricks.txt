Why use main in Python
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4041238/why-use-def-main

        def main():
            print("hello")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()

    If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value "__main__".
    If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module's name.

    IMP:
    Your code can also be imported and used in another module.
    By doing the main check, you can have that code only execute when you want to run the module as a program and not have it execute when someone just wants to import your module and call your functions themselves.

    # file one.py
        def func():
            print("func() in one.py")

        print("top-level in one.py")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print("one.py is being run directly")
        else:
            print("one.py is being imported into another module")

    # file two.py
        import one

        print("top-level in two.py")
        one.func()

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print("two.py is being run directly")
        else:
            print("two.py is being imported into another module")

    Now, if you invoke the interpreter as
        python one.py

    The output will be
        top-level in one.py
        one.py is being run directly

    If you run two.py instead:
        python two.py

    You get
        top-level in one.py
        one.py is being imported into another module
        top-level in two.py
        func() in one.py
        two.py is being run directly

    Thus, when module one gets loaded, its __name__ equals "one" instead of __main__

Single quotes vs. double quotes in Python
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56011/single-quotes-vs-double-quotes-in-python
http://henry.precheur.org/python/python_quote.html

    Quoting the official docs at https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html:
        In plain English: String literals can be enclosed in matching single quotes (') or double quotes (").
    So there is no difference

    I like to use double quotes around strings that are used for interpolation or that are natural language messages, and
    single quotes for small symbol-like strings, but will break the rules if the strings contain quotes

    Python interpreter is doing when printing string representation:
        If the string doesn’t contain quotes, it will enclose this string with single quotes.
        If the string contains single quotes but no double quotes, it will enclose the string with double quotes.
        And if the string contains both single and double quotes, it will use single quotes

What is the difference between tuples and lists in Python?
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_interview_questions.htm
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1708510/python-list-vs-tuple-when-to-use-each

    Tuples are fixed size in nature whereas lists are dynamic.
    In other words, a tuple is immutable whereas a list is mutable.

    You can't add elements to a tuple. Tuples have no append or extend method.
    You can't remove elements from a tuple. Tuples have no remove or pop method.
    You can find elements in a tuple, since this doesn¿t change the tuple.
    You can also use the in operator to check if an element exists in the tuple.
    Tuples are faster than lists. If you're defining a constant set of values and all you're ever going to do with it is iterate through it, use a tuple instead of a list.

    It makes your code safer if you ¿write-protect¿ data that does not need to be changed. Using a tuple instead of a list is like having an implied assert statement that this data is constant, and that special thought (and a specific function) is required to override that.

    Some tuples can be used as dictionary keys (specifically, tuples that contain immutable values like strings, numbers, and other tuples). Lists can never be used as dictionary keys, because lists are not immutable.

    The main differences between lists and tuples are -
        Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while
        tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated.
    Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

10a.
TUPLES

    tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);
    tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );
    tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d";

    The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing ¿
    tup1 = ();

    Tuples are immutable which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements. You are able to take portions of existing tuples to create new tuples

11.
Python Dictionary
http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_interview_questions.htm

    Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type.
    They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs.
    A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings.
    Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

        dict = {}
        dict['one'] = "This is one"
        dict[2]     = "This is two"
        tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}

        dict.keys()
        dict.values()

Iterating over dictionaries using 'for' loops
    key is just a variable name.

        for key in d:
    will simply loop over the keys in the dictionary, rather than the keys and values. To loop over both key and value you can use the following:

    For Python 2.x:
        for key, value in d.iteritems():
    For Python 3.x:
        for key, value in d.items():

20.
DICTIONARY:
    - Dictornaries are MUTABLE
    A dictionary is similar to a list, but you access values by looking up a key instead of an index.
    A key can be any string or number.
    Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces

        menu = {} # Empty dictionary
        menu['Chicken Alfredo'] = 14.50 # Adding new key-value pair

        str(len(menu))

        del menu[key_name]

    IT CAN STORE DIFFERENT DATA TYPES
        my_dict = {
            "fish": ["c", "a", "r", "p"],
            "cash": -4483,
            "luck": "good"
        }
        print my_dict["fish"][0]

    PRINT
        d = {"foo" : "bar"}

        for key in d:
            print d[key]    # IMP

        prices = {"banana" : 4, "apple" : 2, "orange" : 1.5, "pear" : 3}
        stock = {"banana" : 6, "apple" : 0, "orange" : 32, "pear" : 15}

        for item in prices:
            print item
            print "price: %s" % prices[item]
            print "stock: %s" % stock[item]

Sort a dictionary based on values OR keys
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/613183/sort-a-python-dictionary-by-value?rq=1

    As simple as: sorted(dict1, key=dict1.get)

    It is not possible to sort a dict, only to get a representation of a dict that is sorted.
    Dicts are inherently orderless, but other types, such as lists and tuples, are not.
    So you need a sorted representation, which will be a list—probably a list of tuples.

    For instance,
        import operator
        x = {1: 2, 3: 4, 4: 3, 2: 1, 0: 0}
        sorted_x = sorted(x.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))

    sorted_x will be a list of tuples sorted by the second element in each tuple.
    dict(sorted_x) == x.

    And for those wishing to sort on keys instead of values:
        import operator
        x = {1: 2, 3: 4, 4: 3, 2: 1, 0: 0}
        sorted_x = sorted(x.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(0))

11a.
Dictionary with mutiple keys having different values
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10664856/make-dictionary-with-duplicate-keys-in-python

    Python dictionaries don't support duplicate keys. One way around is to store lists or sets inside the dictionary.

    One easy way to achieve this is by using defaultdict:
        from collections import defaultdict
        data_dict = defaultdict(list)
    All you have to do is replace
        data_dict[regNumber] = details
    with
        data_dict[regNumber].append(details)
    and you'll get a dictionary of lists.

11b.
Ordered Dictionary
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1867861/python-dictionary-keep-keys-values-in-same-order-as-declared

What is GIL Global Interpreter Lock?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/265687/why-the-global-interpreter-lock
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1294382/what-is-a-global-interpreter-lock-gil

    Python's GIL is intended to serialize access to interpreter internals from different threads.
    On multi-core systems, it means that multiple threads can't effectively make use of multiple cores.

    In general, for any thread safety problem you will need to protect your internal data structures with locks. This can be done with various levels of granularity.

        You can use fine-grained locking, where every separate structure has its own lock.
        You can use coarse-grained locking where one lock protects everything (the GIL approach).

    There are various pros and cons of each method.
    Fine-grained locking allows greater parallelism - two threads can execute in parallel when they don't share any resources.
    However there is a much larger administrative overhead. For every line of code, you may need to acquire and release several locks.

    The coarse grained approach is the opposite.
    Two threads can't run at the same time, but an individual thread will run faster because its not doing so much bookkeeping.
    Ultimately it comes down to a tradeoff between single-threaded speed and parallelism.

Python Objects: Mutable vs. Immutable
https://codehabitude.com/2013/12/24/python-objects-mutable-vs-immutable/

    The following are immutable objects:
        Numeric types: int, float, complex
        string
        tuple
        frozen set
        bytes

    The following objects are mutable:
        list
        dict
        set
        byte array

Aren't Python strings immutable
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9097994/arent-python-strings-immutable

        a = "Dog"
        b = "eats"
        c = "treats"

        print a, b, c
        # Dog eats treats

        print a
        # Dog

        a = a + " " + b + " " + c
        print a
        # Dog eats treats

    First a pointed to the string "Dog".
    Then you changed the variable a to point at a new string "Dog eats treats".
    You didn't actually mutate the string "Dog".
    Strings are immutable, variables can point at whatever they want.

Why are Python strings immutable
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8680080/why-are-python-strings-immutable-best-practices-for-using-them
    - Immutable objects are automatically threadsafe.

    When you receive a string, you'll be sure that it stays the same.
    Suppose that you'd construct a Foo as below with a string argument, and would then modify the string; then the Foo's name would suddenly change:

        class Foo(object):
            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name

        name = "Hello"
        foo = Foo(name)
        name[0] = "J"

    - With mutable strings, you'd have to make copies all the time to prevent bad things from happening.
    - It also allows the convenience that a single character is no different from a string of length one, so all string operators apply to characters as well.

    IMP:
    And lastly, if strings weren't immutable, you couldn't reliably use them as keys in a dict, since their hash value might suddenly change.

    As for programming with immutable strings, just get used to treating them the same way you treat numbers: as values, not as objects.

    Changing the first letter of name would be
        name = "J" + name[1:]

How do I pass a variable by reference
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/986006/how-do-i-pass-a-variable-by-reference

    ANS: pass by assignment

    IMP:
    When you call a function with a parameter, a new reference is created that refers to the object passed in. This is separate from the reference that was used in the function call, so there's no way to update that reference and make it refer to a new object. In your example:
        self.variable = 'Original'
        self.Change(self.variable)

    def Change(self, var):
        var = 'Changed'

    self.variable is a reference to the string object 'Original'.
    When you call Change you create a second reference var to the object.
    Inside the function you reassign the reference var to a different string object 'Changed', but the reference self.variable is separate and does not change.

    The only way around this is to pass a mutable object.
    Because both references refer to the same object, any changes to the object are reflected in both places.

        self.variable = ['Original']
        self.Change(self.variable)

    def Change(self, var):
        var[0] = 'Changed'

    ------
    Think of stuff being passed by assignment instead of by reference/by value.
    That way, it is allways clear, what is happening as long as you understand what happens during normal assignment.

    So, when passing a list to a function/method, the list is assigned to the parameter name.
    Appending to the list will result in the list being modified.
    Reassigning the list inside the function will not change the original list, since:
        a = [1, 2, 3]
        b = a
        b.append(4)
        b = ['a', 'b']
        print a, b      # prints [1, 2, 3, 4] ['a', 'b']

Shebang line First line in python

    #! /usr/bin/env
    #! /usr/bin/env python

    In order to run the python script, we need to tell the shell three things:
        1.That the file is a script
        2. Which interpreter we want to execute the script
        3. The path of said interpreter

    The shebang #! accomplishes (1.).
    The shebang begins with a # because the # character is a comment marker in many scripting languages.
    The contents of the shebang line are therefore automatically ignored by the interpreter.

    The env command accomplishes (2.) and (3.).

    If you have several versions of Python installed, /usr/bin/env will ensure the interpreter used is the first one on your environment's $PATH.
    The alternative would be to hardcode something like #!/usr/bin/python; that's ok, but less flexible.

        Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
        errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
        that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
        Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
        or repr(object).
        encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().

Python CLASSes

34a. Python type class and metaclass
https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-oop/python-type-class/
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/392160/what-are-some-concrete-use-cases-for-metaclasses

    A metaclass is a class that creates other classes. By default, Python uses the type metaclass to create other classes.

    type is a metaclass, of which classes are instances. Just as an ordinary object is an instance of a class, any new-style class in Python, and thus any class in Python 3, is an instance of the type metaclass.

    In the below case:
    - x is an instance of class Foo.
    - Foo is an instance of the type metaclass.
    - type is also an instance of the type metaclass, so it is an instance of itself.

    Remember that, in Python, everything is an object. Classes are objects as well. As a result, a class must have a type
        >>> class Foo:
        ...     pass
        ...
        >>> x = Foo()

        >>> type(x)
        <class '__main__.Foo'>

        >>> type(Foo)
        <class 'type'>
    The type of x is class Foo, as you would expect. But the type of Foo, the class itself, is type. In general, the type of any new-style class is type.

34a1. How to create 'type' class
https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses/
    You can also call type() with three arguments¿type(<name>, <bases>, <dct>):
        - <name> specifies the class name. This becomes the __name__ attribute of the class.
        - <bases> specifies a tuple of the base classes from which the class inherits. This becomes the __bases__ attribute of the class.
        - <dct> specifies a namespace dictionary containing definitions for the class body. This becomes the __dict__ attribute of the class.
    Calling type() in this manner creates a new instance of the type metaclass. In other words, it dynamically creates a new class.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22609272/python-typename-bases-dict
NICE EXPLANATION
    When you define a class:
        class Foo(Base1, Base2):
            bar = 'baz'

            def spam(self):
                 return 'ham'

    Python essentially does this:
        def spam(self):
            return 'ham'
        body = {'bar': 'baz', 'spam': spam}

        Foo = type('Foo', (Base1, Base2), body)
    where Foo is then added to the namespace the class statement was defined in.

    The block under the class statement is executed as if it was a function with no arguments and the resulting local namespace (a dictionary) forms the class body; in this case a dictionary with 'bar' and 'spam' keys is formed.

    You can achieve the same result by passing a name string, a tuple of base classes and a dictionary with string keys to the type() function.

Python Class Static Variable and Class Variable
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9056957/correct-way-to-define-class-variables-in-python

    - Elements outside the __init__ method are static elements.
      It means, they belong to the class.
    - Elements inside the __init__ method are elements of the object (self).
      They don't belong to the class.

    You'll see it more clearly with some code:
        class MyClass:
            static_elem = 123

            def __init__(self):
                self.object_elem = 456

        c1 = MyClass()
        c2 = MyClass()

        # Initial values of both elements
        >>> print c1.static_elem, c1.object_elem
        123 456
        >>> print c2.static_elem, c2.object_elem
        123 456

        # Nothing new so far ...

        # Let's try changing the static element
        MyClass.static_elem = 999

        >>> print c1.static_elem, c1.object_elem
        999 456
        >>> print c2.static_elem, c2.object_elem
        999 456

        # Now, let's try changing the object element
        c1.object_elem = 888

        >>> print c1.static_elem, c1.object_elem
        999 888
        >>> print c2.static_elem, c2.object_elem
        999 456

34c.
Static Methods
https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/

    There is a class of methods, called static methods, that don't have access to self.
    They are methods that work without requiring an instance to be present.
    Since instances are always referenced through self, static methods have no self parameter.

    The following would be a valid static method on the Car class:
        class Car(object):
            ...
            def make_car_sound():
                print 'VRooooommmm!'

    No matter what kind of car we have, it always makes the same sound (or so I tell my ten month old daughter).
    To make it clear that this method should not receive the instance as the first parameter (i.e. self on "normal" methods), the @staticmethod decorator is used, turning our definition into:

        class Car(object):
            ...
            @staticmethod
            def make_car_sound():
                print 'VRooooommmm!'

Python Multiple Inheritence
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277367/how-does-pythons-super-work-with-multiple-inheritance

        class First(object):
            def __init__(self):
                print "first"

        class Second(object):
            def __init__(self):
                print "second"

        class Third(First, Second):
            def __init__(self):
                super(Third, self).__init__()
                print "that's it"

    But, briefly: in your example, Third() will call First.__init__.
    For such simple situations, Python will look for the attribute (in this case, __init__) on the class's parents, left to right.

    So, if you define
        class Third(First, Second):
            ...

    Python will look at First, and, if First doesn't have the attribute, at Second.

    This situation becomes more complex when inheritance starts crossing paths (say, if First inherited from Second, for instance).
    Read the link above for more details, but, in a nutshell, Python will try to maintain the order in which each class appears on the inheritance list, child classes first.

    So, for instance, if you had:
        class First(object):
            def __init__(self):
                print "first"

        class Second(First):
            def __init__(self):
                print "second"

        class Third(First):
            def __init__(self):
                print "third"

        class Fourth(Second, Third):
            def __init__(self):
                super(Fourth, self).__init__()
                print "that's it"

    the MRO would be [Fourth, Second, Third, First].

    By the way: if Python cannot find a coherent method resolution order, it'll raise an exception, instead of falling back to a behaviour which might surprise the user.

    Edited to add example of an ambiguous MRO:
        class First(object):
            def __init__(self):
                print "first"

        class Second(First):
            def __init__(self):
                print "second"

        class Third(First, Second):
            def __init__(self):
                print "third"

    Should Third's MRO be [First, Second] or [Second, First]? There's no obvious expectation, and Python will raise an error:
        TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases Cannot create a consistent method resolution order (MRO) for bases Second, First

What are the options to clone or copy a list in Python?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2612802/how-to-clone-or-copy-a-list

    What are the options to clone or copy a list in Python?
    Using new_list = my_list then modifies new_list every time my_list changes.
    Why is this?

    You have various possibilities:

        1. You can slice it:
               new_list = old_list[:]

        2. You can use the built in list() function:
               new_list = list(old_list)

        3. You can use generic copy.copy():
               import copy
               new_list = copy.copy(old_list)
           This is a little slower than list() because it has to find out the datatype of old_list first.

        4. If the list contains objects and you want to copy them as well, use generic copy.deepcopy():
               import copy
               new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)
           Obviously the slowest and most memory-needing method, but sometimes unavoidable.

    10.59 sec (105.9us/itn) - copy.deepcopy(old_list)
    10.16 sec (101.6us/itn) - pure python Copy() method copying classes with deepcopy
    1.488 sec (14.88us/itn) - pure python Copy() method not copying classes (only dicts/lists/tuples)
    0.325 sec (3.25us/itn) - for item in old_list: new_list.append(item)
    0.217 sec (2.17us/itn) - [i for i in old_list] (a list comprehension)
    0.186 sec (1.86us/itn) - copy.copy(old_list)
    0.075 sec (0.75us/itn) - list(old_list)
    0.053 sec (0.53us/itn) - new_list = []; new_list.extend(old_list)
    0.039 sec (0.39us/itn) - old_list[:] (list slicing)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do
    READ THIS LINK

    To understand what yield does, you must understand what generators are. And before generators come iterables.

    Iterables
    When you create a list, you can read its items one by one. Reading its items one by one is called iteration:

    >>> mylist = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> for i in mylist:
    ...    print(i)
    1
    2
    3
    mylist is an iterable. When you use a list comprehension, you create a list, and so an iterable:

    >>> mylist = [x*x for x in range(3)]
    >>> for i in mylist:
    ...    print(i)
    0
    1
    4
    Everything you can use "for... in..." on is an iterable; lists, strings, files...

    These iterables are handy because you can read them as much as you wish, but you store all the values in memory and this is not always what you want when you have a lot of values.

    Generators
    Generators are iterators, a kind of iterable you can only iterate over once. Generators do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly:

    >>> mygenerator = (x*x for x in range(3))
    >>> for i in mygenerator:
    ...    print(i)
    0
    1
    4
    It is just the same except you used () instead of []. BUT, you cannot perform for i in mygenerator a second time since generators can only be used once: they calculate 0, then forget about it and calculate 1, and end calculating 4, one by one.

    Yield
    yield is a keyword that is used like return, except the function will return a generator.

    >>> def createGenerator():
    ...    mylist = range(3)
    ...    for i in mylist:
    ...        yield i*i
    ...
    >>> mygenerator = createGenerator() # create a generator
    >>> print(mygenerator) # mygenerator is an object!
    <generator object createGenerator at 0xb7555c34>
    >>> for i in mygenerator:
    ...     print(i)
    0
    1
    4
    Here it's a useless example, but it's handy when you know your function will return a huge set of values that you will only need to read once.

    To master yield, you must understand that when you call the function, the code you have written in the function body does not run. The function only returns the generator object, this is a bit tricky :-)

    Then, your code will be run each time the for uses the generator.

    Now the hard part:

    The first time the for calls the generator object created from your function, it will run the code in your function from the beginning until it hits yield, then it'll return the first value of the loop. Then, each other call will run the loop you have written in the function one more time, and return the next value, until there is no value to return.

    The generator is considered empty once the function runs but does not hit yield anymore. It can be because the loop had come to an end, or because you do not satisfy an "if/else" anymore.

56. Ignore hidden files using os.listdir()
    You can write one yourself:


    def listdir_nohidden(path):
        for f in os.listdir(path):
            if not f.startswith('.'):
                yield f
    Or you can use a glob:

    def listdir_nohidden(path):
        return glob.glob(os.path.join(path, '*'))
    Either of these will ignore all filenames beginning with '.'

57. Generating Discrete random variables with specified weights using SciPy or NumPy
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11373192/generating-discrete-random-variables-with-specified-weights-using-scipy-or-numpy
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4265988/generate-random-numbers-with-a-given-numerical-distribution

    Drawing from a discrete distribution is directly built into numpy. The function is called random.choice (difficult to find without any reference to discrete distributions in the numpy docs).

    elements = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]
    probabilities = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]
    np.random.choice(elements, 10, p=probabilities)

    scipy.stats.rv_discrete might be what you want. You can supply your probabilities via the values parameter. You can then use the rvs() method of the distribution object to generate random numbers.

    As pointed out by Eugene Pakhomov in the comments, you can also pass a p keyword parameter to numpy.random.choice(), e.g.

    numpy.random.choice(numpy.arange(1, 7), p=[0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2])

58. How to remove item from a python list if a condition is True? [duplicate]

    y = [s for s in x if len(s) == 2]
    somelist = [x for x in somelist if not determine(x)]

    The answers suggesting list comprehensions are ALMOST correct -- except that they build a completely new list and then give it the same name the old list as, they do NOT modify the old list in place. That's different from what you'd be doing by selective removal, as in @Lennart's suggestion -- it's faster, but if your list is accessed via multiple references the fact that you're just reseating one of the references and NOT altering the list object itself can lead to subtle, disastrous bugs.

    somelist[:] = [x for x in somelist if not determine(x)]

    Note the subtle difference with other answers: this one is NOT assigning to a barename - it's assigning to a list slice that just happens to be the entire list, thereby replacing the list contents within the same Python list object, rather than just reseating one reference

59. How do I list all files of a directory?

    os.listdir() will get you everything that's in a directory - files and directories.

    If you want just files, you could either filter this down using os.path:
        from os import listdir
        from os.path import isfile, join
        onlyfiles = [f for f in listdir(mypath) if isfile(join(mypath, f))]

60. list index out of range error using random.choice

    Refer to https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html
    random.choice(seq) raises IndexError if the seq is empty.

61. Convert generator object to list for debugging [duplicate]

    Simply call list on the generator.
    lst = list(gen)

62. Python AttributeError: Object has no attribute

    Your indentation is goofed, and you've mixed tabs and spaces. Run the script with python -tt to verify

63. How to randomly select an item from a list?

    Use random.choice:
        import random
        foo = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        print(random.choice(foo))

64. double equals vs is in python [duplicate]
    is checks that 2 arguments refer to the same object, == checks that 2 arguments have the same value.

65. Is it possible only to declare a variable without assigning any value in Python?
    var = None

66. In Python how should I test if a variable is None, True or False

    if result is None:
        print "error parsing stream"
    elif result:
        print "result pass"
    else:
        print "result fail"
