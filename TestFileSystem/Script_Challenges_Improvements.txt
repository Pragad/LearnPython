Bugs that got discovered over time:
1. First modified the existing script to accept two directories (source and target)
2. Saved the attributes that gets applied for an operation and used that to perform the same operation on target
3. Created backup files before deleting the files
    3a. This way we will have all files to compare
    3b. Problem: The backup files that we create will get picked up as well (Not a real problem)
    3c. Problem: Say we have a file a.txt and delete it by creating a backup (a.txt.old) 
                 Now, if we create 'a.txt' again and try to delte it, it will fail as backup (a.txt.old) already exists
        Solution: Not created backup files (.old) because deleting it from kcfs will just move it to trash
4. Files were getting created only in the parent directory and not in the sub directory
    - Fixed it but still Files were not getting created deep enough
    - Fixed it by using a deeper path to create files and dirs
5. How to handle delete when multiple instances of the script is run
    - Say a file gets picked up for "read / write" after doing a list.dir(). Now another instance went ahead and deleted the file / dir
    - The first instance will fail to perform read / write
6. Thread1 created basepath/d1 and kcfspath/d1 is in progress
   Thread2 picks  up basepath/d1/f1 as a file to create and now when kcfspath/d1/f1 is being created, it will fail thread1 is not done with the create.
7. Diff should ignore "dot files"
   - How diff pattern should be given
8. Create dense files instead of sparse files by writing from start instead of a random offset
